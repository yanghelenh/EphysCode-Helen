% measureAccessResistance.m
%
% Function that acquires a trial of voltage clamp data with the seal test
%  on and uses it to calculate the access resistance, input resistance, 
%  and the holding current.
% Saves the recording in the present working directory
%
% INPUT:
%   settings - struct of ephys setup settings, from ephysSettings()
%
% OUTPUT:
%   holdingCurrent - average current being injected to hold voltage (pA)
%   accessResistance - deltaV / delta transient current (MOhms)
%   inputResistance - deltaV / delta steady state current (MOhms)
