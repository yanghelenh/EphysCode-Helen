% preprocessFicTrac.m
%
% Function for preprocessing raw FicTrac voltage data acquired on the user
%  DAQ. Takes 0-10V signal of heading, intX, and
%  intY and returns angular position and velocity for each dimension. For x
%  and y, also returns position and velocity in distance units (mm). Raw
%  voltage signal is lowpass filtered 2X with cutoff specified by
%  LOWPASS_FILTER_CUTOFF. MAX_YAW_VELOCITY, MAX_FWD_VELOCITY, 
%  MAX_SLIDE_VELOCITY specify max anglular velocities in each of these 
%  dimensions. If they are exceeded, program assumes they're errors and 
%  replaces them with previous value that was below threshold.
%
% NOTE: Current output of FicTrac (using Wilson lab shenanigans version of
%  FicTrac.cpp), intX and intY are forward and slide (i.e. they don't
%  incorporate fly's heading)
%
% Adapted from function of same name in 2PAnalysisCode-Helen
%
% INPUTS:
%   daqData - struct of data from experimental DAQ, processed by
%       preprocessUserDaq()
%   sampRate - sampling rate of acquisition
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   yawAngVel - yaw angular velocity, in deg/sec
%   yawAngPosWrap - yaw angular position (heading), wrapped between 0 and 
%       360 deg
%   fwdVel - forward velocity, in mm/sec
%   fwdCumPos - distance traveled in the forward direction, with trial
%       start being 0 mm (signed)
%   slideVel - slide/lateral velocity, in mm/sec
%   slideCumPos - distance traveled in the lateral direction, with trial
%       start being 0 mm (signed)
%   xPos - x position, in mm, if fly were walking on xy plane
%   yPos - y position, in mm, if fly were walking on xy plane
