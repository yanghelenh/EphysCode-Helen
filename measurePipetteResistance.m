% measurePipetteResistance.m
%
% Function to calculate pipette or seal resistance by acquiring voltage
%  and current data when seal test is on.
% Will run for duration set by settings.sealTestDur
% Saves actual recordings in a folder in the pwd called preExptTrials
%
% INPUTS:
%   settings - struct of ephys setup settings, from ephysSettings()
%   type - string indicating whether we're measuring pipette or seal
%       resistance (options are either 'pipette' or 'seal')
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   pipetteResistance - pipette/seal resistance in MOhms
